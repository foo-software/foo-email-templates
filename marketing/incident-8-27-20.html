          Hello! We've invested in a robust infrastructure (on Kubernetes) for highly available services with little to zero downtime. However, events from Thursday - Friday led to brief periods of downtime and degradation in Lighthouse performance audits. This issue was addressed, but put a spotlight on our need for better communication. In response, we've created the following spaces (also linked in the website navigation).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/foo-software/discussion/issues" style="color: #304ffe;">General discussion</a>: Anything goes here. Not sure where to discuss a topic? Questions about how our website works? This is the place.</li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/foo-software/incidents/issues" style="color: #304ffe;">Incidents</a>: In the event of user-impacting issues, we'll post real-time updates here.
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/foo-software/incidents/issues" style="color: #304ffe;">Open incidents</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/foo-software/incidents/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed" style="color: #304ffe;">Closed incidents</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/foo-software/bugs/issues" style="color: #304ffe;">Bugs</a>: Did you discover a bug? Open an issue here or review existing ones. We have a couple in progress, so have a look if you've noticed anything unusual.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/foo-software/features/issues" style="color: #304ffe;">Features</a>: Have an idea that would really help your workflow? It doesn't hurt to put in a request. We're open to any ideas, even half-baked.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>User Impact of this Recent Incident</h3>
        <p style="font-size:18px;">
          Performance reports from 8/27 - 8/28 could show lower scores than expected. A few periods of downtime on Friday occurred, but for no longer than a few minutes at a time. The public API was functioning incorrectly for approximately 15 minutes in the middle of the day.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p style="font-size:18px;">
          This was the first outage since our migration to Kubernetes about 6 months ago. These incidents will be rare, but hopefully we now offer a satisfactory space to promote collaboration and ensure we're transparent regarding bugs, features, incidents and general discussion.
